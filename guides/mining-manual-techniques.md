## Equipment Progression

### Stage 1: Hand Scanner (Priority #1)

The most important early-game tool.

| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Cost** | Low (iron, electronics) |
| **Power** | None (passive) |
| **Range** | ~20 meters |
| **Function** | Detects nearby ore |

**Usage:**
1. Craft at workbench
2. Equip in hand slot
3. Walk around - scanner shows nearby ore
4. Visual indicators appear on nearby terrain

**Reading Scanner Output:**
- **No indicator**: No ore nearby
- **Faint outline**: Low density ore (skip if alternatives)
- **Visible pattern**: Medium density (good source)
- **Solid block**: High density (excellent source)

**Pro Tips:**
- Keep equipped while exploring
- Walk in grid patterns for thorough coverage
- Mark rich deposits with beacons or flags
- Note multiple ore types in same area

---

### Stage 2: Hand Mining Drill

After locating deposits, extract ore efficiently.

## Ore Scanning

### Systematic Search Patterns

**Grid Search:**
```
Start → → → →
       ↓
       ← ← ← ←
       ↓
       → → → →
```
- Cover large area methodically
- ~20m spacing between passes
- Mark finds with beacons
- Build base near best concentration

**Radial Search:**
- Start from base
- Walk outward in spiral
- Good for early base placement
- Limited range exploration

**Elevation Search:**
- Scan at different heights
- Hills and valleys may differ
- Cliff faces often have exposed ore
- Use jetpack for vertical coverage

### Reading Ore Indicators

**Iron:**
- Most common
- Dark gray/red coloring
- Often near surface

**Copper:**
- Orange/brown tint
- Medium depth common

**Gold:**
- Yellow/orange sparkle
- Deep deposits

**Coal (Carbon):**
- Black coloring
- Often surface or shallow

**Silver:**
- Silver/gray metallic
- Deep deposits

**Lead:**
- Dark gray, heavy
- Medium depth

### Mapping Deposits

Create an ore map:

1. Place beacon at rich deposit
2. Label beacon (e.g., "Iron - High")
3. Note compass direction from base
4. Approximate distance
5. Multiple ore types? Note each

**Example Map Entry:**
```
Location: N45° from base, 50m distance
Ores: Iron (high), Copper (medium)
Depth: Surface to 10m
Notes: Good base location candidate
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Beginner Errors

1. **Not using hand scanner** - Wandering blindly is inefficient
2. **Ignoring battery charge** - Stranded with dead drill is frustrating
3. **Mining in wrong pressure** - Suit deaths are common
4. **No storage planning** - Ore on ground despawns or gets lost
5. **Poor base location** - Far from ore = lots of walking

### Strategic Errors

1. **Automating too early** - Waste limited resources
2. **Wrong ore priority** - Gold before iron = no construction materials
3. **Ignoring power** - Drill that can't run is useless
4. **No expansion planning** - Back yourself into a corner

### Safety Mistakes

1. **Digging straight down** - Cave-ins, falling, getting stuck
2. **No emergency oxygen** - Run out = death
3. **Ignoring temperature** - Freeze or overheat
4. **No shelter** - Caught in storm, no protection
