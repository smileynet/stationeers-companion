# Ore Deposits by Environment

Complete reference for ore locations and distribution in Stationeers.

## Overview

Ore distribution varies by environment (planet/moon) and depth. Understanding these patterns helps optimize mining operations and base placement.

## Ore Distribution by Environment

### Mars

| Silver | Uncommon | Deep | Electronics, trading |
| Lead | Common | Medium | Batteries |
| Nickel | Uncommon | Deep | Alloys (Invar, etc.) |
| Cobalt | Rare | Deep | Super alloys |
| Silicon | Common | Deep | Electronics |
| Uranium | Rare | Very Deep | Nuclear fuel |
| Carbon | Abundant | Surface | Steel making |

**Mars Characteristics:**
- Best overall balance of ore types
- Surface iron and coal readily available
- Moderate depth requirements for rarer ores
- Warm temperatures reduce heating needs

### Moon / Asteroid

| Ore | Availability | Depth | Notes |
|-----|--------------|-------|-------|
| Iron | Abundant | Surface to Deep | Metallic asteroids |
| Copper | Common | Medium to Deep | Present but scattered |
| Gold | Common | Deep | Richer than Mars |
| Silver | Common | Deep | Richer than Mars |
| Lead | Rare | Medium | Scarce |
| Nickel | Abundant | Deep | Asteroid mining |
| Cobalt | Common | Deep | Good sources |
| Silicon | Uncommon | Deep | Scarce |
| Uranium | Rare | Very Deep | Present |
| Carbon | Rare | Surface | Organic scarcity |

**Moon/Asteroid Characteristics:**
- Rich in metallic ores (iron, nickel, gold, silver)
- Poor in organics (carbon, biomass)
- Vacuum requires full life support
- Extreme temperature swings
- Solar power with batteries essential

### Venus

| Ore | Availability | Depth | Notes |
|-----|--------------|-------|-------|
| Iron | Abundant | Surface to Deep | Similar to Mars |
| Copper | Common | Medium to Deep | Present |
| Gold | Uncommon | Deep | Standard rarity |
| Silver | Uncommon | Deep | Standard rarity |
| Lead | Abundant | Medium | Better than Mars |
| Nickel | Uncommon | Deep | Standard rarity |
| Cobalt | Rare | Deep | Standard rarity |
| Silicon | Common | Deep | Present |
| Uranium | Rare | Very Deep | Present |
| Carbon | Abundant | Surface | Atmosphere organics |

**Venus Characteristics:**
- High pressure atmosphere challenges
- Abundant lead and carbon
- Corrosive atmosphere damages equipment
- Hot temperatures require cooling
- Solar limited, use generators

### Europa (Icy Moon)

| Ore | Availability | Depth | Notes |
|-----|--------------|-------|-------|
| Iron | Abundant | Deep | Ocean floor deposits |
| Copper | Common | Deep | Present |
| Gold | Uncommon | Very Deep | Deep crust |
| Silver | Uncommon | Very Deep | Deep crust |
| Lead | Common | Deep | Present |
| Nickel | Uncommon | Very Deep | Deep crust |
| Cobalt | Rare | Very Deep | Deep crust |
| Silicon | Uncommon | Deep | Present |
| Uranium | Rare | Very Deep | Present |
| Carbon | Abundant | Surface | Ice organics |

**Europa Characteristics:**
- Sub-surface ocean mining
- Ice layer penetration required
- Abundant water
- Cold temperatures
- Potential for biological resources

## Depth Guidelines

### Surface Ore (0-5m)
- Can be collected with hand
- No drill required initially
- Iron, carbon, sometimes other ores
- Depletes quickly

### Shallow Deposits (5-20m)
- Hand mining drill effective
- Common ores: Iron, copper, lead
- Accessible with minimal equipment
- Good for early game

### Medium Depth (20-50m)
- Requires mining drill device
- Better ore variety
- Gold, silver become available
- Infrastructure setup needed

### Deep Deposits (50-100m)
- Requires deep miner or excavator
- Rare ores (cobalt, uranium)
- Significant investment required
- High yield operations

### Very Deep (100m+)
- Deep miner or excavator essential
- Best uranium sources
- Complex mining operations
- Industrial scale recommended

## Ore Finding Techniques

### 1. Hand Scanner (Passive)
- Equip and walk around
- Shows nearby ore indicators
- Range: ~20m radius
- Best for surface deposits

### 2. Scanner Network (Advanced)
- Multiple scanners for coverage
- IC10 can aggregate readings
- Build comprehensive ore map
- Requires automation knowledge

### 3. Exploratory Mining
- Dig test shafts
- Check exposed strata
- Note ore concentrations
- Plan efficient extraction

### 4. Satellite Imaging (Future)
- Orbital survey planned
- Regional ore mapping
- Advanced technique
- Not yet fully implemented

## Mining Efficiency Tips

### Optimal Base Placement
1. **Scan first** - Map ore deposits before building
2. **Proximity matters** - Build near target ores
3. **Multiple sources** - Access to 3+ ore types ideal
4. **Depth consideration** - Surface iron for early, deep uranium for late

### Ore Priorities by Game Stage

**Early Game (Days 1-7):**
- Iron (construction)
- Carbon (steel)
- Copper (basic electronics)

**Mid Game (Days 7-21):**
- Gold (advanced electronics)
- Silver (advanced electronics)
- Lead (batteries)
- Nickel (alloys)

**Late Game (Days 21+):**
- Cobalt (super alloys)
- Uranium (nuclear power)
- Bulk iron (mass production)

### Reading Ore Concentrations

When using hand scanner or mining:
- **High density** - Rich deposit, prioritize
- **Medium density** - Standard yield
- **Low density** - Poor yield, skip if alternatives exist
- **Mixed** - Multiple ores in one vein, good value
