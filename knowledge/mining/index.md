## Quick Reference

### Ore Types

| Ore | Environment | Depth | Uses |
|-----|-------------|-------|------|
| Iron | All | Surface + | Construction, steel |
| Copper | Mars, Moon | Medium | Electronics |
| Gold | All | Deep | Electronics, trading |
| Silver | All | Deep | Electronics |
| Lead | Mars, Venus | Medium | Batteries |
| Nickel | All | Deep | Alloys |
| Cobalt | All | Deep | Alloys |
| Silicon | Mars, Moon | Deep | Electronics |
| Uranium | All | Very Deep | Nuclear fuel |
| Carbon | All | Surface | Steel component |

### Equipment Progression

1. **Hand Scanner** - Find ore deposits (passive)
2. **Mining Drill (Hand)** - Manual ore extraction
3. **Mining Drill (Device)** - Stationary, IC10-ready
4. **Excavator** - Large-scale deep mining
5. **Deep Miner** - Automated endless ore

## Environment Considerations

### Mars
- **Atmosphere**: Thin CO2 (breathing required)
- **Temperature**: Moderate (-60°C to 20°C)
- **Ore Distribution**: Good variety, moderate depth
- **Power**: Solar viable

### Moon / Asteroid
- **Atmosphere**: Vacuum (full suit required)
- **Temperature**: Extreme (-150°C to 100°C)
- **Ore Distribution**: Rich metals, sparse organics
- **Power**: Solar with battery critical

### Venus
- **Atmosphere**: High pressure, corrosive
- **Temperature**: Hot (400°C+)
- **Ore Distribution**: Similar to Mars
- **Power**: Generators preferred

## Mining Stages

### Stage 1: Surface Collection (Day 1)
- Gather surface ores with hand
- Locate rich deposits with scanner
- Establish small shelter

### Stage 2: Manual Mining (Days 2-7)
- Use hand mining drill
- Excavate shallow deposits
- Stockpile key resources (iron, coal)

### Stage 3: Basic Automation (Days 7-21)
- Deploy stationary mining drill
- Auto-sort with hash-based sorter
- Feed into arc furnace

### Stage 4: Industrial Scale (Days 21+)
- Multi-drill arrays
- Conveyor transport systems
- Integrated smelting operations
- Deep mining or excavators

## Version Notes

- Updated for Stationeers 1.0+
- Ore distribution may change with updates
